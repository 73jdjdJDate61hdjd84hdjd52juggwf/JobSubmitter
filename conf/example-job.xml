	This is a example of workloads configuration.
	Label <jobs> can contain manay jobs, and label
	<tasks> can contiaine manay tasks.
	
	jobId: 			String. Each job has a unique id.
	
	jobName:		Without effect in current version.
	description:    Without effect in current version.
	
	starttime: 		Integer. After sleep this duration time count 
					in second, the job is submitted. And the 
					resources remaining indeed determine the job 
					can run or not.
	
	priority:		Integer. Job priority.
	
	taskId:			String. Each task has a unique id in a job.
	
	execSequence:	Integer. It means the sequence of tasks. Tasks 
					which has same sequence will be executed at the
					same time if the resources enough. And in this 
					example, task "0003" will be executed when task 
					"0001" and "0002" are done, and you can control 
					tasks running as DAG in the same way.         
	jarPath:		Each task need a executable to run. You can set 
					all tasks use the same executable or different.
					If you want to change the executable's type, you 
					need to modify the parameter "-task_type" in 
					`./sh/runexampletask.sh`
	
	resourceAlloc:  Integer. The size of YARN container with vcores
					and memory(MB).

	resourceConsume:Double. `csps` is abbreviation for "core second 
					per second", means how long the task running.       -->
